# Backtrack Debugging App

Web app which focuses on people learning or keen on recursion. The web app is providing animation on solutions commited by the author or by the user (very early stage). The animation is providing information on every mark or unmark of the algorithm. Components:

1. In the "Animation" section you will see the flow of the algorithm

2. In the "Velocity" section you have control over the animation (by default "Very Fast" is selected).

3. In the "Debugger" component you can see which value currently is being marked/unmarked (relates to point 1).
